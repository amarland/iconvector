action-info.{lo,hi}-res.ivg are low- and high-resolution IconVG versions
of an SVG file that comes from the Material Design icon set.
See action/svg/production/ic_info_48px.svg in the
github.com/google/material-design-icons repository.
Low resolution means that coordinates are quantized to 1/64th of a unit;
the graphic's size is 48 by 48 units. High resolution means that
coordinates are represented by all but the 2 least significant bits of a
float32. Each low resolution coordinate is encoded in either 1 or 2 bytes. Each
high resolution coordinate is encoded in either 1, 2 or 4 bytes.

arcs.ivg is inspired by the two examples at
